# Comp Graphic and Visualization Journal
In designing software for my OpenGL 3D scene project, I adopted a systematic approach involving prototyping and iterative refinement. I aim to practice software development in a way that promotes teamwork, readability, and efficiency in all of my work, and this process helped me develop key design skills such as modularization and applying design patterns effectively. The iterative approach allowed me to progressively enhance features, incorporating feedback to improve the projectâ€™s functionality and alignment with objectives.
For development, I focused on optimizing performance and visual fidelity using strategies like shader programming and texture mapping. Iteration played a crucial role, enabling continuous improvements and resolution of technical challenges. My coding evolved from procedural scripting to a more structured, object-oriented approach. Overall, my experience with OpenGL has deepened my understanding of computational graphics, offering valuable skills for both educational and professional applications in fields like virtual reality and game development.
